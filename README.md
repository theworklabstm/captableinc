<h4 id="without-docker">Development environment without Docker</h4>

> This has been tested on Mac OS and works really well. If you are using Linux/Windows/WSL, you might need to install some additional dependencies.

- [Fork the repository](https://github.com/captableinc/captable/fork)

- Clone the repository

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-github-name>/captable.git
  ```

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

- Install latest version of node and pnpm
- Install latest version of postgres database
- Install [mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/install/) for SMTP and email interception
- Create database `captable` in postgres database
- Update `.env` file's `DATABASE_URL` with database credentials
- For a quick start, you can use [Supabase database](https://supabase.com/) or [Neon](https://neon.tech/) as well.
- To simulate file storage locally, install `minio` via homebrew or any other package manager.

  ```bash
  brew install minio
  ```

  Once minio is installed run
  ```bash
  minio server start --console-address ":9002"
  ```

  This will start minio server <br>
  minio api will be available on `http://127.0.0.1:9000` and <br>
  minio web gui will be available on `http://127.0.0.1:9002`.

  once you see these endpoint in terminal, update the following `.env`:
  
  ```bash
  UPLOAD_ENDPOINT="http://127.0.0.1:9000" # should match minio api server's endpoint
  NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOAD_DOMAIN="http://127.0.0.1:9000" # should match minio api server's endpoint
  UPLOAD_REGION="us-east-1" # don't change it
  UPLOAD_ACCESS_KEY_ID="minioadmin" # by default minio username is "minioadmin"
  UPLOAD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="minioadmin" # by default minio password is "minioadmin"
  UPLOAD_BUCKET_PUBLIC="captable-public-bucket"
  UPLOAD_BUCKET_PRIVATE="captable-private-bucket"
  ```

  after this,
  go to minio web gui(`http://127.0.0.1:9002`) and login: <br>
  username: `minioadmin` <br>
  password: `minioadmin`

  and create two buckets with the name: <br> `captable-public-bucket` and `captable-private-bucket`,<br> this should match `UPLOAD_BUCKET_PUBLIC` and `UPLOAD_BUCKET_PRIVATE` env's values.

  and you should be done with minio setup.

- Run the following command to install dependencies

  ```bash

- Run the following command to migrate and seed the database
